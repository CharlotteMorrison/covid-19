Several 34 bioaerosol samplers and analytical methods have been used; however, the detection and 35 quantification of influenza virus among aerosol samples remains challenging. Therefore, 36 improved viral aerosol measurement methods are needed. This study evaluated influenza virus 37 recovery among three filter types polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride and polystyrene. 38 Polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylchloride are fabricated filter materials and commonly used in 39 the scientific literature to sample for viral aerosols. A novel, electrospun polystyrene filter 40 material may improve viral aerosol recovery during filter-based air sampling. The filter materials 41 were compared across the following conditions: treated with or without air, filter wash buffer 42 (HBSS or PBS), and viral RNA extraction method (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit or Trizol). 43 Twenty trials were completed in a chamber and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Viral 44 recovery was significantly different (p-value < .0001) by filter type. Polystyrene filter use 45 resulted in recovery of the most viral RNA. Air sampling did not affect the recovery of viral 46 RNA from the filter materials (p-values > 0.05). Viral RNA concentrations were significantly 47 different across extraction methods for all comparisons (p-values < 0.05). Our results 48 demonstrated that the novel polystyrene filter material resulted in the highest concentration of 49 extracted RNA compared to the commonly used polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride, 50 which we speculate may be related to the chemical composition of the filter material (e.g., 51 polystyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon whereas polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinylchloride 52 contain more polar, and thus potentially reactive, carbon-halogen bonds).

First, the PS filter material was fabricated differently than the other filter 248 materials. Electrospinning produces a nanostructured mat consisting of nonwoven fibers, 249 whereas the other polymers (PTFE and PVC) are more traditional polymer films. The nanofiber 250 mat of PS is sufficiently dense and may capture a greater number of viruses and release them 251 efficiently compared to PTFE and PVC polymer films. Additional work is needed to directly 252 compare PS nanofiber mats to PTFE or PVC also fabricated by electrospinning, thus producing 253 similarly nanostructured layers.254 Alternatively, rather than just physical differences, differences in the chemical composition 255 of the polymers may result in the increased performance. Specifically, the base monomers of 256 PTFE [(C 2 F 4 ) n ] and PVC [(C 2 H 3 Cl) n ] contain halogen atoms (fluorine and chlorine, 257 respectively), whereas PS [(C 8 H 8 ) n ] is an aromatic hydrocarbon-based polymer. Carbon-halogen 258 bonds are more polar, and thus potentially more reactive, than simple hydrocarbon bonds. 36 259 Thus, chemical environments produced by surface fluorine and chlorine may result in conditions 260 that affect the viability of RNA captured on more traditional, halogen-containing polymer 261 materials (i.e., PTFE and PVC). 37 262 In this experiment, we failed to detect evidence that the treatment of filters with simulated 263 sampling air affected the recovery of RNA from the filter materials (Kit, HBSS: Air vs. No-Air had on viral recovery 10,19 it was hypothesized that air being pulled through filter 267 materials would affect the viral recovery. The results of this experiment dispute this observation 268 given the environmental and sampling conditions used in this experiment are similar previous 269 studies using air sampling. 9,25 270 Using HBSS and PBS as a filter wash buffer resulted in viral recoveries that were 271 significantly different, depending on the RNA extraction method used (Kit, Air or No-Air: HBSS 272 vs. PBS p-value = 0.0001, 0.0001; Trizol, Air or No-Air: HBSS vs. PBS p-value = 0.0322, 273 0.499). Using HBSS as a wash buffer resulted in greater viral recovery then PBS when using the 274 QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, but slightly lower recovery when using HBSS and Trizol. Our 275 results align with previous studies which indicate that HBSS and PBS can be used in the removal 276 of virus from sampling materials 13,14,17 , however no other studies have looked at the effect 277 different wash buffer has on viral recovery. 278 Viral RNA copies were significantly different when using the Kit and Trizol RNA extraction 279 methods for all comparisons (HBSS, Air or No-Air: Kit vs. Trizol p-value = 0.0021, 0.0013; 280 PBS, Air or No-Air: Kit vs. Trizol p-value = 0.0001, 0.0002). Viral RNA copies were higher 281 with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit when using HBSS, and higher with the Trizol method 282 when using PBS. Previous studies have found that Trizol extraction methods typically produce 283 higher copies of viral RNA when compared to other extraction methods 24,38,39 , however previous 284 studies have not evaluated whether wash buffer type affects viral RNA copies as was observed in 285 this study.\",\n",

Determining whether virus particles collected are active (i.e., viable and contagious) is 308 important in the prevention and control of influenza virus infection.
